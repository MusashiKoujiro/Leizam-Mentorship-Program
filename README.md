# Leizam-Mentorship-Program
A resources guide for participants in the Leizam Mentorship Program

## Learning
Learning how to learn efficiently is at the core of being a successful developer as you'll always be learning new things.

It is therefore highly reccomended that you develop a system for integrating new information into your existing knowledge base to keep up with the demands of the field.

Recommended resources:
- [Learning How To Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) - A free Coursera course on learning efficiently.

## Problem Solving

Programming is problem solving.

Developing your problem solving skills, like any other skill, requires consistent practise and effort.

Recommended resources:
- [Think Like A Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Programmer-Introduction-Creative/dp/1593274246) - The book uses C++ but the overall concept remains the same. Adapt it to your preferred language.

## Health
Being a developer involves long periods of sitting, staring at a screen and typing .

The burden of this extended state of immobility cannot be overstated.

I will be focusing on three key areas that require improvement : Posture, Flexiblity and Hand health

Recommended resources:
- [Repetitive Strain Injury](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/rsi.html) - A comprehensive resource on rsi.
- [Stretching](https://www.reddit.com/r/flexibility/wiki/starting_to_stretch?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=3) - Stretching is [important](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-stretching) as it keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and that flexibility is needed to maintain a range of motion in the joints.
- [Posture](https://www.amazon.com/New-Rules-Posture-Stand-Modern/dp/1594771243) - Book on a holistic view of posture and how to correct postural imbalances.


## Introduction

 Understanding the fundamentals of computers work is essential in becoming a good programmer. 

Recommended resources :

## Git/Github
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

[Github](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git

You'll be using Git/Github a lot so best to learn it.

Recommended resources:

- [Commit Messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) - Having a good commit message history will allow you (or other developers working on your code) to quickly see what changes were made and why. This is useful if a bug is found in the code that needs to be fixed!

## C#
[C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. 

C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

It is the primary language you'll be using at Leizam, specifically the objected oriented aspect.

## Conclusion
The above guide might be daunting at first, but everything is hard at first.
Practise consistently and it won't seem unsurmountable anymore.

However, don't get sidetracked by trying to go through all of the resources provided.
